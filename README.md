# 🌌 CryptoGalaxy — Immersive Blockchain Network Visualization

**CryptoGalaxy** is an open-source project that transforms blockchain transaction data into an immersive, symbolic, and dynamic graph-based universe.

> Think of it as a living star map of the cryptosphere — part visualization tool, part exploration engine.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Visualize blockchain networks as dynamic, temporal graphs.
- Represent wallets, smart contracts, mixers, and exchanges as distinct celestial entities.
- Enable intuitive understanding of on-chain flows and behavioral patterns.
- Create a modular, community-driven platform for blockchain analysis, education, and discovery.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (`networkx`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`)
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (`Plotly.js`, `vis.js`, or `Three.js`)
- **Data:** Simulated or real on-chain data (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
